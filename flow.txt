E-COMMERCE SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT FLOW
=====================================

This document explains the step-by-step development process of building a minimal Python-only E-commerce system with FastAPI backend, SDK, and demo script.

PROJECT OVERVIEW
================
The system consists of:
- FastAPI RESTful backend with in-memory storage
- Python SDK for easy API interaction
- Demo script showcasing complete buyer/seller workflows
- No database dependencies (in-memory storage only)
- CORS enabled for frontend compatibility

ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS
======================
1. FastAPI: Chosen for modern async support, automatic API docs, and type safety
2. Pydantic Models: For data validation and serialization
3. In-memory Storage: Simple, no external dependencies, perfect for demo
4. SDK Pattern: Encapsulates API calls for easy integration
5. User ID System: Simple string-based user identification for cart isolation

BACKEND DEVELOPMENT (backend/)
==============================

Step 1: Data Models (models.py)
-------------------------------
- Product: Core entity with id, name, price, description
- ProductCreate/ProductUpdate: Input validation models
- CartItem: Represents items in shopping cart
- Cart: Container for cart items
- OrderItem: Order line items with product details
- Order: Complete order with total and timestamp

Key Design Decisions:
- Used Optional fields in ProductUpdate for partial updates
- CartItem stores product_id and quantity (normalized approach)
- OrderItem includes product details for historical accuracy
- DateTime for order tracking

Step 2: In-Memory Storage (memory_store.py)
-------------------------------------------
- MemoryStore class manages all data persistence
- Auto-incrementing IDs for products and orders
- User-based cart isolation
- Dictionary-based storage for O(1) lookups

Key Features:
- Thread-safe operations (single-threaded for simplicity)
- Automatic ID generation
- Cart management with user isolation
- Order creation with cart clearing
- Product validation before cart operations

Step 3: FastAPI Application (main.py)
-------------------------------------
- RESTful endpoints following REST conventions
- CORS middleware for frontend compatibility
- Proper HTTP status codes and error handling
- Query parameters for user_id and quantity
- JSON request/response handling

API Endpoints:
Seller APIs:
- POST /products - Create product
- GET /products - List all products
- GET /products/{id} - Get specific product
- PUT /products/{id} - Update product
- DELETE /products/{id} - Delete product

Buyer APIs:
- POST /cart - Add to cart
- GET /cart - View cart
- DELETE /cart/{id} - Remove from cart
- POST /checkout - Create order

SDK DEVELOPMENT (sdk/)
======================

Step 4: EcommerceSDK (ecommerce_sdk.py)
---------------------------------------
- Requests-based HTTP client
- Session management for connection reuse
- Configurable base URL and user ID
- Method mapping to API endpoints
- Error handling with raise_for_status()

Key Features:
- Clean method names matching business operations
- Type hints for better IDE support
- Flexible parameter handling
- Health check capability
- User ID management for cart operations

DEMO SCRIPT DEVELOPMENT
=======================

Step 5: Demo Script (demo.py)
-----------------------------
- Complete workflow demonstration
- Seller and buyer persona simulation
- Error handling and user feedback
- Pretty printing with separators
- Real-time progress indication

Demo Flow:
1. Health check and backend verification
2. Seller adds multiple products
3. Seller lists and updates products
4. Buyer views available products
5. Buyer adds items to cart
6. Buyer views cart contents
7. Buyer removes items from cart
8. Buyer completes checkout
9. Order summary display
10. Seller deletes products

TESTING STRATEGY
================
- Manual testing through demo script
- API endpoint validation
- Error scenario handling
- Data consistency checks
- User isolation verification

DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS
=========================
- Single-file backend execution
- No external dependencies beyond FastAPI
- In-memory storage (data lost on restart)
- Development server configuration
- CORS settings for production

FUTURE EXTENSIONS
=================

Database Integration:
- Replace MemoryStore with SQLAlchemy
- Add database migrations
- Implement connection pooling
- Add data persistence

Authentication & Authorization:
- JWT token system
- User registration/login
- Role-based access control
- API key management

Advanced Features:
- Product categories and search
- Inventory management
- Order history and tracking
- Payment integration
- Email notifications
- Admin dashboard

Performance Optimizations:
- Redis caching
- Database indexing
- API rate limiting
- Response compression
- Async database operations

Monitoring & Logging:
- Request/response logging
- Error tracking
- Performance metrics
- Health check endpoints
- API documentation

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
=======================
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- Rate limiting
- HTTPS enforcement
- API authentication

The system is designed to be minimal yet complete, demonstrating core e-commerce functionality while maintaining clean, production-ready code structure.
